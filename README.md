Personal projects that feature a little bit of everything I've learned so far

## catfood
In this project I scrape all of the entries in a cat food review website, clean them and group them into a data frame, analyze them looking for patterns in its rating system, and design a model in order to predict cat food scores.

Skills:
- Web scraping
- Data cleaning
- Data analysis
- Training and evaluation of simple predictive models

Tools:
- ```scrapy```
- ```pandas```
- ```seaborn```
- ```scikit-learn```
