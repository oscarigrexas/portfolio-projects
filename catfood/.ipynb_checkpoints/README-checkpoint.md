# catfood

My first *actually interesting* web-crawling-based project!

Setting: I want to identify the best brands of cat food for my lovely hypothetical cats.
Idea: I can crawl the wonderful website [CatFoodDB](http://catfooddb.com/), collect the relevant features and data about each of the reviewed products, organize them into a neat table, and then perform some data analysis on them.
Also, the writer of the website decided to rate all of the different brands by giving them nutrition and ingredient "paw scores". I would like to identify what are the parameters that those ratings are based on, and even be able to predict ratings for new and unreviewed cat food products.
Please read through the Jupyter notebook ```catfood.ipynb``` to follow my whole though process and check what conclusions and results I obtain! :)
Tools: Scrapy, Seaborn, scikit-learn
