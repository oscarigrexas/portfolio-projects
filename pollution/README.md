# pollution

I built this project after seeing all of the news concerning the improvements in the pollution situation of many cities during the 2020 coronavirus outbreak.
i wanted to look into the available data for my own city (Vigo), and see if there were any noticeable changes compared to previous years.
A great deal of the work in this project was interacting with meteogalicia's interface (our local metheorology authority) and cleaning and processing all of the raw data.

Skills:
- Request and processing of data accessed as JSON
- Data cleaning
- Data analysis

- ```requests``` and ```json``` modules
- ```pandas```
- ```matplotlib``` and ```seaborn```
